<h1>All About Chess</h1>
<p>My Website project for SDEV 153 will be about the World of Chess. The pages of the website will cover:</p>
  <h2>HOW TO PLAY</h2> 
  <h2>THE EQUIPMENT - BOARDS & CHESS SETS</h2>
  <h2>CLUBS & TOURNAMENTS</h2>
  <h2>HISTORY</h2> 
  <h2>STRATEGY & TACTICS</h2> 
  <p>This is just a first rough draft of this website. The final website needs much more thought before completion.</p>
