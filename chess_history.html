      Chess has a long history, starting nearly 1,500 years ago in India with a game called chaturanga. 
      It spread to Persia, where it became shatranj, and later to Europe via Spain and Italy. By around 1500 CE, 
      the game had evolved into the modern form we play today.

      Over the centuries, chess went through several eras: the Romantic era (late 18th–1880s), focusing on tactical games; 
      the Scientific, Hypermodern, and New Dynamism eras; and the modern tournament era, including the first official World Chess Championship in 1886. 
      In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue computer famously defeated world champion Garry Kasparov, marking the start of computer-assisted chess.

      Today, computer analysis and online chess have greatly influenced how the game is played, studied, and enjoyed worldwide.
